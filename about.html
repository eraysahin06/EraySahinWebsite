    <h2 class="hi">Who am I?</h2>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px;" class="about-text">
        <span>After</span> completing my secondary education in Ankara, Turkey, I came to Toronto, Canada to continue my education at <a href="https://www.senecacollege.ca/home.html" class="innergo"> Seneca College</a> Applied Arts & Technology - Computer Programming. I am interested in game programming and completed some game projects including mobile and desktop games using the Unity Game Engine and C# programming language. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
 When I went to Turkey for a summer break, I worked at  <a href="https://www.netsinerji.com.tr/" class="innergo">Netsinerji Bilişim</a> as an SQL Programmer for a month and improved my work experience. Even though I didn't have enough time because I spent 2 months in Turkey and I was a seasonal employee, it was a great experience for me.
 Apart from the C and C++ languages ​​I learned at school, I continue to improve myself in C#, Java, and Python programming languages, and I will also attend the SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) boot camp, a 6-month certificate program prepared by <a href="https://techno.study/" class="innergo">Techno Study</a>, at the end of October 2022.
 During my secondary education, I attended many Model United Nations conferences including <a href="https://bhmun.org/" class="innergo">Bilkent University Historical MUN</a>  and I tried to take part in all possible voluntary events and activities.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
 There are also fields that I am interested in other than game and application development, such as motorsports and music production, and drawing. I have been granted a distinction award from the <a href="https://www.uwl.ac.uk/study/music" class="innergo"> University of West London </a>- College of Music Examinations - Electric Guitar Grade 1 Examination.
